# IOT-based-tollgate-collection-using-RFID-technology
This project describes the automated toll collection system for tollgate based on RFID technology. 
Most of the toll collection systems commonly used is manual transaction. Nowa-days, streams of traffic are increased and toll gate on highways are congested.
It will cause the traffic jam and wastage of time. The objective is to transform manual transaction to AUTOMATED TOLL COLLECTION with the help of RFID technology. 
In the proposed system, The Internet server maintains all the data of user accounts and also their balance. 
All vehicle owners would possess an RFID based card that stores their account number.
Our system at toll booths will monitor the cards scanned when a car arrives at the toll booth. 
The system now connects to the online server to check if the card is valid and if valid what is the balance. 
If user balance is sufficient, the user balance is deducted online and web system sends signal back to the card scanner system that the user has been billed.
On receiving this signal the system operates a motor to open the toll gate for that car. The system is controlled by a microcontroller to achieve this purpose.
The microcontroller uses WIFI connection to connect to the internet through which system interacts with web server to perform the online verification process. 
Also system allows storing data of all the vehicles passed at particular time intervals for later reference and surveillance. 
This system thus automates the entire toll booth collection and monitoring process with ease using RFID plus IOT based system.
